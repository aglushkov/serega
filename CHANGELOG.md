## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2022-08-24

- Added :const attribute option to specify attribute with constant value

- Added `.call` and `#call` methods same as `.to_h` and `#to_h`. New methods were added as when we can serialize list of objects the result will be array, so `to_h` is a bit confusing

## [0.1.1] - 2022-08-13

- Fix validation and README docs about attribute option `:key`. Previously we validate option :method instead

## [0.1.0] - 2022-08-07

- Initial public release ([@aglushkov][])
